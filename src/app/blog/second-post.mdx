## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs quickly by providing a wide range of utility classes directly in your HTML. When combined with Next.js, it creates a powerful development environment.

## Installation

First, you need to install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies via npm or yarn:

```
bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

or

```
bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

## Configuration

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```
bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create minimal `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files at the root of your project.

## Configure your template paths

Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```
javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

## Include Tailwind directives in your CSS

Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file.

```
css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Start using Tailwind

Now you can start using Tailwind's utility classes in your components and pages!

```
jsx
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
  Hello, Tailwind!
</h1>
```

## Conclusion

Setting up Tailwind CSS with Next.js is straightforward and provides a flexible way to style your applications. Enjoy the power of utility-first CSS!
