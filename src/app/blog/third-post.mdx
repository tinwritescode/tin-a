Adding pagination to your blog list is essential for managing a growing number of posts. It helps improve performance and user experience by loading a limited number of posts at a time.

There are several ways to implement pagination, depending on your setup. If you are fetching data from an API, you can use query parameters like `page` and `limit` to control which posts are returned.

For example, a request might look like this:

```
GET /api/posts?page=2&limit=10
```

On the frontend, you'll need to display navigation controls that allow users to move between pages. This typically involves "Previous" and "Next" buttons, and sometimes a list of page numbers.

When a user clicks a pagination control, you update the current page state and fetch the new set of posts for that page.

Consider the user experience:

- Clearly indicate the current page.
- Disable "Previous" on the first page and "Next" on the last page.
- Provide feedback (e.g., a loading spinner) while fetching new data.

Implementing pagination requires careful handling of state and data fetching, but it's a crucial feature for a scalable blog.
