# Using Shadcn/ui Components

Shadcn/ui provides a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS. They are designed to be copied and pasted directly into your project.

## Installation

To get started, you'll typically use their CLI to add components to your project.
```
bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```
This command adds the Button component to your project's components directory.

## Usage

Once added, you can import and use the components like any other React component:
```
jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Button>Click Me</Button>
  );
}
```
Shadcn/ui components are highly customizable through props and by modifying the component code directly, which lives within your project.

This approach gives you full control over the component's styling and behavior, making it a powerful tool for building custom user interfaces quickly.
